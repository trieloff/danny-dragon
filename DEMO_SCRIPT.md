## ACT 1: "A Little Less Conversation" — The Opening

**[Open the app in browser]**

Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Roadmap Roulette. Thank you. Thank you very much.

You know, every quarter, product teams across the world gather in conference rooms to decide what to build next. They use sticky notes. They use spreadsheets. They use lengthy PRDs that nobody reads. Well, friends, we don't do that here. Here in Las Vegas — I mean, here in *this app* — we place our bets and let the wheel decide.

**[Point to the hero banner and title]**

Notice the tagline: *"Place your bets on what ships next."* Because let's be honest — predicting a roadmap is about as reliable as predicting which way Elvis's hip is going to swing. You just gotta feel it.

## ACT 2: "Don't Be Cruel" — The Board Overview

**[Scroll down to the quarter columns]**

Here's our roadmap, laid out like a card table at the Flamingo. We've got five columns:

- **Q1 through Q4** — your working quarters, each with a 12-point capacity limit
- **House Reserve** — that's the Backlog, or as I like to call it, *Heartbreak Hotel*. Where initiatives go when nobody loves them tender enough to schedule them.

**[Hover over a card to show the lift effect and gold glow]**

Each initiative is a card. See the suit symbols? Spades, diamonds, clubs, hearts — because every roadmap item is a gamble, baby. You're either holding aces or you're bluffing.

**[Point to the theme badges on cards]**

We've got four themes, and they're not your grandma's roadmap categories:

- **High Roller** — that's Growth. Go big or go home.
- **Lucky Streak** — Retention. Keep those users coming back like fans at a comeback tour.
- **House Edge** — Tech Debt. The house always wins, and tech debt always accumulates.
- **Table Stakes** — Compliance. You ain't nothing but a hound dog if you skip your audits.

## ACT 3: "All Shook Up" — Capacity Planning

**[Point to the capacity meters under each quarter header]**

See these meters? Each quarter has a 12-point budget. The sizing follows t-shirt sizing, weighted like so:

| Size | Points | Elvis Equivalent |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| XS | 1 | Adjusting the microphone stand |
| S | 2 | One hip swivel |
| M | 3 | A full verse of "Hound Dog" |
| L | 5 | The entire Aloha from Hawaii special |
| XL | 8 | Building Graceland from scratch |

**[Point to an overloaded quarter if one exists — orange or red meter]**

When a quarter goes over capacity, it turns red and screams OVERLOAD. That's the roadmap equivalent of Elvis trying to fit into the '68 Comeback Special leather suit in 1977. The spirit is willing, but the capacity is full.

## ACT 4: "Suspicious Minds" — Reading the Cards

**[Click on a specific card, e.g., "BUG: Prod Database Running on Intern's Laptop"]**

Let's look at this beauty. *"Prod Database Running on Intern's Laptop."* Description says: uptime 847 days, intern graduated 2 years ago, laptop has a sticker that says 'DO NOT TURN OFF.'

We're caught in a trap. We can't walk out. Because if that laptop reboots, so does the entire company.

**[Point to the dependency badge on a card that has one]**

See this little link icon? That's a dependency. Some cards can't move until other cards are done. It's like — you can't do the encore until you've done the main set. You can't build "Single Sign-On via Carrier Pigeon" until you've finished the "27-Step OAuth Flow for Localhost." The pigeon needs credentials too.

**[Point to the SVG dependency arrows connecting cards]**

Those curved arrows show the dependency flow. Gray means normal. Orange means it's stretching across quarters — a long-distance relationship. Red means the dependency goes *backwards* — and that, friends, is a return to sender. Address unknown.

## ACT 5: "Burning Love" — Completing an Initiative

**[Find an uncompleted card and hover over the circle button]**

Every card has this little circle button. That's the completion toggle. When your team ships something, you click it, and...

**[Click the completion button]**

JACKPOT! 🎰

**[Celebration popup appears with video, dancing image, and "JACKPOT!" title]**

Look at that. Confetti. Music. A dancing image. The whole app is celebrating like Elvis just walked into the building. The King has entered Graceland, and your initiative has entered Production.

**[Point to the "WINNER" banner on the completed card]**

The card now has a gold border and a big "WINNER" stamp rotated across it, like a prize ribbon at the county fair. If I can dream of a roadmap where everything ships on time... well, this is what it looks like.

**[Close the celebration popup]**

---

## ACT 6: "It's Now or Never" — Drag and Drop

**[Pick up a card from the Backlog / House Reserve column]**

Now here's where it gets interesting. You can drag any card from one quarter to another. Watch this — I'm going to take "Implement Synergy Maximization Engine" out of the Backlog and drop it into Q1.

**[Drag the card to Q1, show the green highlight on the target column]**

See how the column lights up green? It's saying *come on in, the water's fine.* And...

**[Drop the card]**

There it goes. The card lands with a bounce animation. The capacity meter updates. The chart updates. The dependency arrows redraw. Everything is all shook up — in a good way.

This is how you reprioritize in real-time. No 3-hour grooming sessions. No passive-aggressive Jira comment threads. Just grab the card and move it, like rearranging the setlist mid-concert because the crowd is going wild.

## ACT 7: "Viva Las Vegas" — Spin the Wheel

**[Scroll up to the header and hover over the "Spin the Wheel" button]**

This. This is why we're here. The pièce de résistance. The moment that separates Roadmap Roulette from every boring planning tool on the market.

You know how every quarter, leadership says "just pick the top priorities"? And then everyone argues for 6 hours? Well, what if we just... let fate decide?

**[Click "🎲 Spin the Wheel"]**

**[Spinning overlay appears with video]**

The wheel is spinning! A video plays — we've got three different spin animations, picked at random, because variety is the spice of life, and Elvis never did the same show twice.

**[Watch as backlog items get randomly redistributed]**

And just like that — every item that was sitting in the House Reserve has been randomly dealt to a quarter. Q1 through Q4. The cards flip in with an animation. The chart rebalances. Capacity meters update.

Is it chaotic? Yes. Is it fair? Absolutely. Is it how Elvis would have planned a product roadmap? Without question.

You can always drag things back if the wheel gives you something ridiculous — like scheduling "Quantum Computing Readiness Assessment" in Q1 when you haven't even finished the "Committee to Form a Committee on Technical Debt." But honestly? The wheel knows. Trust the wheel. The wheel is the King.

## ACT 8: "Love Me Tender" — Adding a New Initiative

**[Scroll to the "Place a New Bet" form at the bottom]**

Of course, you can add your own initiatives too. Let's place a new bet.

**[Fill in the form:]**
- **Name:** `Build a Peanut Butter & Banana Sandwich API`
- **Description:** `RESTful endpoint that accepts bread type, peanut butter viscosity, and banana ripeness. Returns optimal sandwich. The King's recipe, digitized.`
- **Theme:** High Roller (Growth)
- **Size:** L (5 points — it's a big sandwich)
- **Quarter:** Q2

**[Click "🎰 Place Bet"]**

**[Bet placed overlay appears with video]**

The bet is placed! Another celebration video plays. The new card appears in Q2 with a landing bounce animation. The chart updates to reflect the new Growth item in Q2. The capacity meter ticks up.

That's how fast you go from idea to roadmap item. No 14-page business case. No ROI spreadsheet. No waiting for the next quarterly planning offsite at a hotel in Phoenix. You just place your bet and let it ride.

## ACT 9: "The Wonder of You" — The Odds Board

**[Scroll to the chart section: "The Odds Board — Theme Balance"]**

This stacked bar chart shows you the balance of themes across quarters. Are you betting too heavy on Tech Debt in Q3? Is Compliance getting ignored until Q4? This chart tells you at a glance.

**[Click the toggle switch between Count and Effort Points]**

You can toggle between raw initiative **count** and weighted **effort points**. Count tells you how many things you're doing. Effort tells you how *much* you're doing. It's the difference between saying "Elvis recorded 711 songs" and "Elvis recorded 711 songs and also starred in 31 movies and also built Graceland."

Both are true. Only one captures the full picture.

## ACT 10: "Are You Lonesome Tonight?" — The Export

**[Click the 📥 Export button]**

Sometimes you need to share the roadmap with someone who can't — or won't — open the live app. Maybe it's a board member. Maybe it's that one VP who prints all their emails.

**[A file downloads]**

This exports a **read-only HTML snapshot** of the entire board. Everything is preserved — the layout, the cards, the chart (as a static image), the capacity meters. But all interactive elements are stripped out: no dragging, no spinning, no betting. It's a frozen-in-time artifact.

It even adds a banner at the top: *"Read-Only Snapshot — Exported on [date]."*

Think of it as the vinyl pressing of your roadmap. The live show is better, but at least you can take this home and play it on your fax machine.

## ACT 11: "If I Can Dream" — The Close

**[Scroll back to the top, full view of the app]**

So there you have it. Roadmap Roulette. A product planning tool that's equal parts Jira and Caesars Palace. You can:

- ✅ **Drag and drop** initiatives across quarters
- ✅ **Track capacity** with real-time effort meters
- ✅ **Visualize theme balance** with a stacked bar chart
- ✅ **Manage dependencies** with SVG arrows
- ✅ **Spin the wheel** to let fate decide your roadmap
- ✅ **Place bets** on new initiatives
- ✅ **Celebrate wins** with video jackpot popups
- ✅ **Export snapshots** for offline sharing
- ✅ **Complete initiatives** and watch the app lose its mind with joy

Will it replace your quarterly planning process? Maybe. Will it make your quarterly planning process significantly more entertaining? Absolutely. Will it look incredible projected on a conference room screen while you wear a white sequined jumpsuit with a cape? I can confirm that it will.

Thank you. Thank you very much.

**[Take a bow. Throw a scarf into the audience. Leave the building.]**
